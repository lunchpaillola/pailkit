Unkey Authentication and Rate Limiting Middleware.

Requires an `Authorization: Bearer <key>` header on all requests.

When Unkey credentials are provided via environment variables, the presented
key is verified against Unkey. In local/dev without Unkey configured, the
middleware only enforces the presence of the header.
