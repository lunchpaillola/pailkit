# What We’ll Build

In this series, we’ll build a live streaming app that broadcasts directly to YouTube using the [**Daily Video Conferencing Plugin**](https://bubble.io/plugin/daily-video-conferencing--chat-1622494385281x917140771709124600).

Our app will include essential features:

- **User Sign-Up & Login**: A simple interface for account creation and access.
- **Stream Creation & Configuration**: Users can create live streams, set details, and share a link for others to join.
- **Backstage Area**: A backstage view for hosts and participants to join and prepare for live streaming.

Whether for Q&As, webinars, or virtual meetups, this app will allow users to bring audiences together on YouTube with a few clicks.
