  <Step title="Find and Add the YouTube Video ID">
    The YouTube video ID is the unique set of characters at the end of a YouTube URL. For example, in this URL:
    ```
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
    ```
    The video ID is `dQw4w9WgXcQ`. Copy this ID and paste it into the Video ID field in the plugin settings.
