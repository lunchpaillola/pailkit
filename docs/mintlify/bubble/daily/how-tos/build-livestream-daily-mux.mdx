# What We’ll Build

In this series, we’ll build a live-streaming app that streams directly within Bubble using the [**Video, Audio & Live Bundle**](https://bubble.io/plugin/video-audio--live-bundle-1727441795463x240182085842370560) by Lunch Pail Labs.

This app is ideal for use cases where users want to host live streams without external platforms like YouTube or Twitch. It integrates Bubble, Daily, and Mux (all included in the bundle) to provide a seamless experience.

Our app will include these features:

- **User Sign-Up & Login**: A simple interface for account creation and access.
- **Stream Creation & Configuration**: Users can create live streams, set details, and share links for others to join. The streams will play directly within the Bubble app.
- **Backstage Area**: A backstage view for hosts and participants to prepare for live streaming.

This setup is perfect for Q&As, webinars, or virtual meetups hosted directly in Bubble.
