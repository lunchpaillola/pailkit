## Steps

### 1. Add the Daily Events Element

Place the Daily events element somewhere on the page. A common approach is to place it inside a hidden popup that never triggers, keeping it out of view while it listens for events.

### 2. Understand Key Events

The plugin includes several key events that trigger actions when users interact with the call:

- [Joined - meeting](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events#joined-meeting): Fires when the local participant has joined the call, marking the connection.
- [Left - meeting](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events#left-meeting): Fires when the local participant has left the call, marking disconnection.
- [Participant - joined](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/participant-events#participant-joined): Fires when a new remote participant joins the call.
- [Participant - left](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/participant-events#participant-left): Fires when a remote participant leaves the call.
- [Recording started](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/recording-events#recording-started): Fires when a recording starts.
- [Recording stopped](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/recording-events#recording-stopped): Fires when a recording stops.
- [Recording error](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/recording-events#recording-error): Fires when a recording has an error.
- [Active speaker change](https://docs.daily.co/reference/daily-js/events/meeting-events#active-speaker-change): Fires when the active speaker changes, useful for updating the UI during audio-only calls.
- [Transcription - started](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/elements/daily-events#plus-events): Fires for all participants when transcription starts.
- [Transcription - stopped](bubble/daily/plugin-reference/elements/daily-events#plus-events): Fires for all participants when transcription stops.
- [Transcription - error](bubble/daily/plugin-reference/elements/daily-events#plus-events): Emitted for all participants when there has been a transcription error.

### 3. Start Listening to Events

Make sure to add the "begin listening" action after you join a room. This is essential for Bubble to start capturing and processing the events.

### 4. Trigger Actions Based on Events

Use the events to trigger specific actions in your app.

For example, you could:

- Redirect users to a different page once they leave the call.
- Execute actions only after the user has joined the call.

You can check out a [demo editor](https://bubble.io/page?type=page&name=left_meeting_bdk&id=nocodevideodemos&tab=tabs-2) that showcases how these events function within a Bubble app.
