Learn how to automatically generate summaries and transcripts of your Daily video calls. This guide covers both automatic and manual methods for processing call recordings. This is a pay as you go feature add your credit card details to your [Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/billing) to enable it.

## Steps

### 1. Enable Recording in Your Daily Room

First, make sure your room is set up for recording:

1. Use the [create room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-room) or [update room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/update-room) action
2. Enable cloud recording in your room settings

You can start recording either:

- Automatically when an owner joins (set `start cloud recording` in the [meeting token](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-meeting-token)).
- Manually using the [start recording](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/start-recording) action

### 2. Submit the Recording for Processing

Once you have a recording ID (from the recording event or recording action), submit it for processing:

1. Use the [submit job](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/submit-job) action
2. Set the `preset` to "summarize" for summaries + transcripts or just "transcript" for transcripts
3. Set the `source type` to "recordingId"
4. Input your `recording ID`

### 3. Retrieve the Output

Since processing takes time, you have two options to get your results:

#### Option A: Manual Retrieval

Use the [get output from job](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/get-output-from-job) action to fetch the results (note: that processing may take time).

#### Option B: Webhook Automation (Recommended)

Set up [webhooks](/bubble/daily/how-tos/add-webhooks) to automatically process results:

Update your [webhook](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-webhook) to listen for these events:

- `recording.ready-to-download` - Triggers when recording is ready
- `batch-processor.job-finished` - Triggers when processing completes

Update your raw data in bubble to look for this response

  "version": "1.0.0",
  "type": "recording.ready-to-download",
  "id": "rec-rtd-c3df927c-f738-4471-a2b7-066fa7e95a6b-1692124192",

  },
  "event_ts": 1692124192
}
```

## Example Workflow

Here's a complete workflow for automatic summaries:

1. **Start Recording:**

   - Trigger: When owner joins room
   - Action: Start Recording (or use automatic start)

2. **Submit for Processing:**

   - Trigger: When recording.ready-to-download event fires
   - Action: Submit Job with "summarize" preset

3. **Save Results:**
   - Trigger: When batch-processor.job-finished event fires
   - Action: Get Output from Job
   - Action: Save summary to your database

## Best Practices

1. **Recording Setup**

   - Always use cloud recording for summaries
   - Consider automatic recording start for consistency
   - Store recording IDs for reference

2. **Processing**

   - Use webhooks for automated workflows
   - Consider storing both summaries and transcripts

3. **Storage**
   - Save summaries in your database for easy access
