Sometimes, you want to send an app message to trigger an event in your Bubble app. This guide walks through how.

## Steps

### 1. Add the Bundle Daily Events element

Place the [**Bundle Daily Events**](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/elements/daily-events) element on your page. A common practice is to place it inside a hidden popup, keeping it offscreen while it listens for events.

### 2. Start listening for events

After joining the room, add the Begin Listening action. This ensures that Bubble can detect and process incoming events, such as app-message.

### 3. Send app message

Use the [send app message](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/send-app-message) action anywhere in your workflow to transmit a message.

### 4. Handle the app message event

When an app message event is triggered, take action in your app. This could be displaying a popup, showing a notification, or any other custom action you define.

Note: App messages do not trigger for the sender (broadcaster). In this example, we send a notification with the value of the message, but the possibilities are endless.
