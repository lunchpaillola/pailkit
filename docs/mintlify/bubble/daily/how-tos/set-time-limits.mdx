This guide will walk you through how to set time limits for your Daily video calls in your Bubble app. You'll learn two different approaches: setting specific start/end times and setting duration limits for individual participants.

## Two Approaches to Time Limits

There are two main ways to control the duration of your Daily video calls:

1. **Fixed Start and End Times**: Set specific times when the room becomes available and when it expires. This is useful for scheduled meetings or events with defined time slots.

2. **Elapsed Time Limit**: Set a maximum duration for how long each participant can stay in the call, counting from when they join. This is helpful for scenarios like consultation sessions or time-limited meetings.

## Setting Fixed Start and End Times

### 1. Calculate Your Timestamps

First, you'll need to convert your desired start and end times to UNIX timestamps. In Bubble, you can do this using:
`Date/Time: Extract UNIX timestamp/1000`

### 2. Create or Update the Room

When [creating a room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-room) or [updating an existing room](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/update-room), set these parameters:

- Set `not before` to your start time timestamp
- Set `expires` to your end time timestamp
- Set `eject at exp` to `yes` to automatically remove participants when the room expires

## Setting an Elapsed Time Limit

### 1. Create or Update the Room

When [creating](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/create-room) or [updating](/bubble/daily/plugin-reference/actions/update-room) your room:

- Set `eject after elapsed time` to the number of seconds you want participants to be able to stay in the call
- For example, for a 30-minute limit, set it to `1800` (30 minutes × 60 seconds)

![Elapsed Time Settings](https://res.cloudinary.com/dpfmaccxx/image/upload/v1733350531/CleanShot_2024-12-04_at_16.37.49_2x_gnkony.png)

When the time limit is reached, participants will be automatically removed from the call.
