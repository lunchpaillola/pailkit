| -------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **area code**  | Text     | An areacode to search within.                                                                                                                                    |
| **region**     | Text     | A region or state to search within. Must be an ISO 3166-2 alpha-2 code, i.e. CA for California. Cannot be used in combination with areacode.                     |
| **city**       | Text     | A specific City to search within. Example, New York. Must be used in combination with region. Cannot be used with areacode, starts_with, contains, or ends_with. |
| **contains**   | Text     | A string of 3 to 7 digits that should appear somewhere in the number.                                                                                            |
| **start with** | Text     | A string of 3 to 7 digits that should be used as the start of a number. Cannot be used in combination with contains or ends_with.                                |
| **ends with**  | Text     | A string of 3 to 7 digits that should be used as the end of a number. Cannot be used in combination with starts_with or contains.                                |

⚠️ Important Notes:

- Enter either an area code or a region—using both will result in an error.
- To use the city field, you must also enter a region.
- Pick one field: contains, starts with, or ends with—using more than one will cause an error.
