The [PailFlow](https://pailflow.com) integration ships as part of the [Video, Audio & Live Streaming Bundle](/bubble/video-audio-live-bundle/getting-started). Use it to invite AI assistants into Daily-powered calls so they can take notes, summarize meetings, and deliver structured follow-ups directly from your Bubble workflows.

    Go to the [Bubble Plugin Marketplace](https://bubble.io/plugin/video-audio--live-bundle-1727441795463x240182085842370560)
    and install the **Video, Audio & Live Streaming Bundle**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm availability">
    Verify the bundle appears in your Bubble app under **Plugins** so that the PailFlow actions and elements are available.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add your PailFlow API key">

    [PailFlow dashboard](https://pailflow.com).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Prepare your PailFlow account

### 1. Sign up

Create an account at [pailflow.com](https://pailflow.com) if you have not already done so.

### 2. Generate an API key

From your account settings, create an API key. You will use this key in Bubble when configuring the bundle and for any direct API calls.

### 3. Add credits

Each bot run consumes credits (0.15 per minute of bot time). Add funds from your account dashboard before launching bots.

<Note>
  Requests fail with a 402 error if your account does not have enough credits.
</Note>

## Next steps

Use the how-tos and reference content from the bundle to orchestrate Daily rooms, livestreams, and recordings alongside your new PailFlow automations.
