## **What This Workflow Does**

This button **creates and joins a Daily video call room in full-screen mode** with a **15-minute expiration.**

In a live app, you’d likely save the room details in your database—but this workflow provides the **core structure** to create and join a room with an automatic expiration that **ejects participants when the time is up.**

The expiration is set using the **`exp` parameter,** which you can modify to adjust the expiration time. By default, this workflow **automatically ejects** all participants when the room expires. You can change this behavior by setting **`eject at room exp`** to **false.**
