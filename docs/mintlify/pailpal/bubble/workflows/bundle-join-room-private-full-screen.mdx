<Warning>
  This workflow requires the **[Video, Audio & Live
  Bundle](https://bubble.io/plugin/video-audio--live-bundle-1727441795463x240182085842370560)**.
  Install it before proceeding.
</Warning>

## **What This Workflow Does**

This workflow **creates and joins a private Daily video call room in full-screen mode** with **knocking enabled**.

It works like the free version but **leverages the video, audio, and live bundle**. In a live app, you'd likely save the room details in your database—but this workflow provides the **core structure** to create and join a private room where **only authorized users can enter immediately, while others must knock to request access.**

### **How It Works**

This workflow has three key actions:

1️⃣ **Create a Private Room** → The room is created with **knocking enabled**, meaning users without a token must knock to request access.

2️⃣ **Generate a Meeting Token** → The workflow generates an **owner token**, giving the host full control, including letting others in.

3️⃣ **Join Room in Full-Screen Mode** → The host joins the call in full-screen.
