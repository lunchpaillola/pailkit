## Installation and Configuration

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- An Adalo app with users eligible for adding to conversations.
- A TalkJS account. Here's what you'll need:
  - Your App ID, available in [your dashboard](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/) under the settings tab.
  - To customize the Chat UI, adjust settings at [Chat UI settings](https://talkjs.com/dashboard/roles/settings/default/chat-ui) and assign roles appropriately through your dashboard.

### Installation

1. From the Adalo component library, drag and drop the chat component onto your app screen.
2. Input your TalkJS App ID into the component settings.

### Adding Participants

- **"Me" parameter**: Essential for the component's functionality, this parameter identifies the user entering the chat.
- **Adding other participants**: To include more people in a conversation, provide a list of users in the 'participant' parameter. Specify their details like ID, Email, Photo, or Role.

- **Default view**: Without added participants, the component defaults to the inbox view, displaying all conversations involving the user, and will be empty if there are no conversations.
