This guide will help you get started with the PailFlow API to add AI bots to your Daily.co video meetings.

## What is PailFlow?

PailFlow is an API that allows you to add AI-powered bots to your Daily.co video rooms. These bots can:

- Join video meetings and interact with participants
- Take notes, provide assistance, or facilitate conversations
- Automatically transcribe conversations
- Extract insights, Q&A pairs, and summaries from meetings
- Send results via email or webhook callbacks

## Getting Started

### 1. Sign Up

Visit [pailflow.com](https://pailflow.com) and create an account.

### 2. Get Your API Key

Once you've signed up, navigate to your account settings to generate an API key. You'll use this key to authenticate all API requests.

### 3. Add Funds

Before making API calls, you'll need to add credits to your account. Each bot call costs 0.15 credits. You can add funds from your account dashboard.

<Note>
  Make sure you have sufficient credits before making API calls. Requests will
  fail with a 402 error if you don't have enough credits.
</Note>

### 4. Make Your First API Call

Once you have your API key and credits, you can start making API calls. Here's a simple example:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api.pailflow.com/v1/api/bot/join \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "room_url": "https://your-domain.daily.co/room-name",
    "bot_config": {
      "bot_prompt": "You are a helpful AI assistant.",
      "name": "AssistantBot",
      "video_mode": "animated",
      "static_image": "robot01.png"
    },
    "process_insights": true
  }'
```
