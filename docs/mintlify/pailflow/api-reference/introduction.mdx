## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using a Bearer token. Include your API key in the `Authorization` header:

```

You can get your API key from [pailflow.com](https://pailflow.com) after signing up.

## Quick Start Example

  -d '{
    "room_url": "https://your-domain.daily.co/room-name",

      "video_mode": "animated",
      "static_image": "robot01.png"
    },
